## Analyzing HAIs in Brazil (financial perspective)
It is crucial to dive deeper into the inefficient allocation of scarce resources explored in the previous section and analyze how HAIs play a role in contributing to enhancing costs and further diminishing the value for individual patients and the users as a whole. Knowing that HAIs significantly increase the length of a patientâ€™s stay, this part of the analysis aimed to evaluate how meaningfully the average cost of an ICU patient rises with an increase in the number of days. This is a crucial part of work to justify the need for a meaningfully costly technological solution to be acquired by a hospital. This exploratory analysis has not been done before for ICUs in Brazilian public hospitals. Hence, the novel work also provides hospital managers with the tools necessary to estimate how much taxpayer money is being spent and how to maximize the efficiency of that expenditure.
